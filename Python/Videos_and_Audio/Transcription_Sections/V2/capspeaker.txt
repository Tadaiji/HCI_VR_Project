[00:00:001.54 --> 00:00:007.76] [SPEAKER_00]  Well guys, I want to propose a rearrangement of our furniture.

[00:00:011.02 --> 00:00:015.98] [SPEAKER_00]  Because as you can see, this room seems a bit packed.

[00:00:001.59 --> 00:00:002.11] [SPEAKER_01]  Well guys.

[00:00:003.35 --> 00:00:003.61] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah.

[00:00:018.74 --> 00:00:020.20] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, I also think...

[00:00:018.89 --> 00:00:018.89] [SPEAKER_01] 

[00:00:025.52 --> 00:00:033.13] [SPEAKER_00]  three to four years now yeah let's do something different this time

[00:00:035.26 --> 00:00:040.94] [SPEAKER_01]  Well, I would suggest you sell the old furniture first. That would be more essential.

[00:00:041.64 --> 00:00:046.48] [SPEAKER_01]  So by selling you can get some money as well. So you can make your choice

[00:00:046.48 --> 00:00:052.74] [SPEAKER_01]  standard a little bit high as well. And there is also some furniture lying in the basement.

[00:00:053.90 --> 00:01:000.36] [SPEAKER_01]  And also there are yeah, you know, the basement got some stuff from me as well. But yeah,

[00:01:000.44 --> 00:01:003.22] [SPEAKER_01]  this basement stuff you need to sell. This is an old

[00:00:059.97 --> 00:00:059.98] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah.

[00:01:005.95 --> 00:01:012.56] [SPEAKER_01]  last few months. It's also lying there and also some Chinese pots there, old

[00:01:012.56 --> 00:01:019.72] [SPEAKER_01]  Chinese pots and of course this small table. Yeah. I think we need to get rid of

[00:01:019.72 --> 00:01:024.56] [SPEAKER_01]  all that stuff and then we can get the new furniture.

[00:01:007.73 --> 00:01:008.01] [SPEAKER_02]  So

[00:01:025.68 --> 00:01:030.44] [SPEAKER_02]  I think we should call the garbage disposal for this.

[00:01:031.84 --> 00:01:036.20] [SPEAKER_02]  So that they can take the pots and the table and the stuff with them.

[00:01:036.52 --> 00:01:039.60] [SPEAKER_02]  But I want a new sleeping sofa.

[00:01:040.94 --> 00:01:047.52] [SPEAKER_02]  So and a new table if we get even get rid of the old table because the old table isn't

[00:01:047.52 --> 00:01:055.08] [SPEAKER_02]  big enough for us and the new sleeping cup for the old sleeping coach to stay there in

[00:01:055.08 --> 00:01:055.20] [SPEAKER_02]  a few.

[00:01:055.82 --> 00:02:001.88] [SPEAKER_02]  And with the sleeping couch we had the problem that our guests needed to sleep on the floor

[00:02:001.88 --> 00:02:005.12] [SPEAKER_02]  and this isn't how a sleeping couch should work.

[00:02:005.24 --> 00:02:011.32] [SPEAKER_02]  So I think we should buy a new one and a new table while we're at it.

[00:02:011.44 --> 00:02:015.00] [SPEAKER_02]  So that we have enough space when more people are coming over.

[00:01:054.23 --> 00:01:054.23] [SPEAKER_00] 

[00:02:016.34 --> 00:02:023.62] [SPEAKER_01]  to IKEA last time and the tables were really good there also the color combination were really

[00:02:023.62 --> 00:02:031.40] [SPEAKER_01]  cool so I think you can take a look on their website and we can also make some decision with

[00:02:031.40 --> 00:02:040.18] [SPEAKER_01]  that also there is a friend of mine who is working for the farm and there this truck comes and take

[00:02:040.18 --> 00:02:042.98] [SPEAKER_01]  stuff and takes from you yeah that would be a

[00:02:042.45 --> 00:02:043.93] [SPEAKER_02]  That would be helpful, yeah?

[00:02:044.13 --> 00:02:046.01] [SPEAKER_02]  Yes, that would be really helpful.

[00:02:046.89 --> 00:02:053.55] [SPEAKER_02]  And I think I also have a sleeping couch in mind, which I want.

[00:02:054.87 --> 00:02:056.31] [SPEAKER_02]  So, which is also from IKEA.

[00:02:057.91 --> 00:02:059.77] [SPEAKER_02]  But yeah, we can do that.

[00:02:056.52 --> 00:02:057.14] [SPEAKER_00]  That's right.

[00:03:001.28 --> 00:03:009.24] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, that's a good idea, especially considering the condition of the couch at the moment.

[00:03:009.24 --> 00:03:011.75] [SPEAKER_00]  A new one would be nice.

[00:03:011.75 --> 00:03:015.85] [SPEAKER_00]  Would be really nice and if people could sleep on it even better.

[00:03:017.16 --> 00:03:017.16] [SPEAKER_00] 

[00:03:017.16 --> 00:03:027.84] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, and while we're at it, I would suggest that we buy curtains for our window.

[00:03:027.84 --> 00:03:028.28] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah.

[00:03:028.53 --> 00:03:030.66] [SPEAKER_00]  Because the old window blinds.

[00:03:015.12 --> 00:03:015.68] [SPEAKER_01]  even better.

[00:03:027.84 --> 00:03:028.10] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah.

[00:03:034.47 --> 00:03:039.75] [SPEAKER_00]  I think the standard of living would certainly increase if we had some curtains.

[00:03:040.89 --> 00:03:046.23] [SPEAKER_00]  By that I don't mean these old white ones our grandmas and grandpas have,

[00:03:046.55 --> 00:03:048.25] [SPEAKER_00]  but maybe something a bit more colorful.

[00:03:048.83 --> 00:03:055.25] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, sounds good and I think the new curtains could also help us with lighting in the room.

[00:03:055.71 --> 00:04:000.49] [SPEAKER_02]  So we have a little bit more light when even when we want to close the curtains.

[00:04:001.37 --> 00:04:005.79] [SPEAKER_02]  Because with these blinds we don't have much light here anymore.

[00:04:007.43 --> 00:04:010.83] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah and I want to remove the wall to wall carpet.

[00:04:012.37 --> 00:04:019.31] [SPEAKER_01]  The thing is before doing this window blind stuff think we need to get rid of this wall-to-wall carpet

[00:04:019.31 --> 00:04:026.89] [SPEAKER_01]  Yes, sometimes in the summer when we open the window a lot of dust there. It's also not healthy and

[00:04:026.89 --> 00:04:028.81] [SPEAKER_01]  Because of that we need to clean

[00:04:028.81 --> 00:04:031.27] [SPEAKER_01]  most of the time

[00:04:031.27 --> 00:04:038.27] [SPEAKER_01]  Vacuum cleaner so also the consumption of electricity so I think we can get rid of this thing

[00:04:038.27 --> 00:04:046.01] [SPEAKER_01]  This is the modern era veniles are very much into the market. They are easy to clean and you can also wash them

[00:04:046.01 --> 00:04:051.37] [SPEAKER_01]  Partially so getting venile is a good idea. I believe what you guys think about it. Yeah

[00:04:019.48 --> 00:04:019.50] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah.

[00:04:051.40 --> 00:04:059.06] [SPEAKER_02]  I think so too and I think we can get it kind of cheap if we find something like reposts or

[00:04:059.06 --> 00:05:003.85] [SPEAKER_02]  They are selling stuff. They don't have that much more of them

[00:05:003.85 --> 00:05:006.40] [SPEAKER_02]  So but we only want to do it in one room

[00:05:006.40 --> 00:05:010.96] [SPEAKER_02]  So we don't need that much and we can get it cheaper there. Yeah

[00:05:010.42 --> 00:05:030.60] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, as much as I like the idea of putting vinyl on the floor, we have to remember that this would be way more expensive, obviously, to redo the floor.

[00:05:030.68 --> 00:05:039.04] [SPEAKER_00]  And it would be way more work than before, because we have to put everything out of the room and back in.

[00:05:039.78 --> 00:05:054.14] [SPEAKER_00]  I just want to say that. In the end, I think the pros outperform the cons. It has to be done in some way.

[00:05:054.50 --> 00:05:057.46] [SPEAKER_00]  Looking at the floor, it's a bit...

[00:05:017.83 --> 00:05:018.11] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah.

[00:05:018.17 --> 00:05:018.61] [SPEAKER_02]  On the floor.

[00:05:029.43 --> 00:05:030.33] [SPEAKER_02]  redo the floor

[00:05:030.44 --> 00:05:030.94] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah.

[00:05:049.74 --> 00:05:050.02] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah.

[00:05:059.95 --> 00:06:002.29] [SPEAKER_00]  that nice to be totally honest.

[00:06:002.73 --> 00:06:002.73] [SPEAKER_00] 

[00:06:002.73 --> 00:06:003.81] [SPEAKER_00]  So yeah, probably.

[00:06:010.27 --> 00:06:015.15] [SPEAKER_01]  He got really good vinyl so we can and his father owns a vinyl business

[00:06:015.15 --> 00:06:021.93] [SPEAKER_01]  So yeah, so today evening we can go for a walk and you can see his vinyl and we can ask his father

[00:06:021.93 --> 00:06:026.35] [SPEAKER_01]  To help us to get the cheap and the good one in the fair price

[00:06:026.35 --> 00:06:032.77] [SPEAKER_01]  So they can also as we have the good reference of my friend so they can set it up for us

[00:06:032.77 --> 00:06:038.27] [SPEAKER_01]  They will come to some time to our home. They will take the dimension and everything they can help us with that

[00:06:038.59 --> 00:06:044.85] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, maybe they also can help us with the installation of the floor and ripping out.

[00:06:046.75 --> 00:06:051.59] [SPEAKER_02]  But if we are ripping out the floor, we also need to move the furniture.

[00:06:052.27 --> 00:06:053.77] [SPEAKER_02]  So what do we do with that?

[00:06:054.26 --> 00:06:057.26] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, yeah, I want to come back to that.

[00:07:006.00 --> 00:07:012.36] [SPEAKER_00]  But I'd still say we should move it behind me on this wall.

[00:07:012.74 --> 00:07:018.94] [SPEAKER_00]  And just to have more room for people and gatherings.

[00:07:021.58 --> 00:07:029.38] [SPEAKER_00]  But I think we have to discuss if we have enough room after that.

[00:07:030.66 --> 00:07:031.96] [SPEAKER_00]  In the whole living room.

[00:07:032.42 --> 00:07:037.98] [SPEAKER_00]  Because when we keep the old couch and sofa and buy a new one which is

[00:07:031.84 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02]  I'm going to go ahead and

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.86] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:07:031.86 --> 00:07:031.96] [SPEAKER_02]  I'm going to go ahead and

[00:07:044.83 --> 00:07:049.75] [SPEAKER_00]  quiet pet and that's the very thing we wanted to not have.

[00:07:051.07 --> 00:07:053.29] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

[00:07:053.89 --> 00:08:002.09] [SPEAKER_01]  Well, the smart way to do this movement stuff, I think we should start placing things in

[00:08:002.09 --> 00:08:002.57] [SPEAKER_01]  the corner.

[00:08:002.71 --> 00:08:008.15] [SPEAKER_01]  As long as we have things in the middle or unorganized, they occupy lots of our space

[00:08:008.15 --> 00:08:012.27] [SPEAKER_01]  and we usually didn't get some place to arrange our stuff.

[00:08:012.29 --> 00:08:015.93] [SPEAKER_01]  So I would suggest we can have our sofa in the corner.

[00:08:016.25 --> 00:08:016.97] [SPEAKER_01]  And this corner?

[00:08:018.01 --> 00:08:023.13] [SPEAKER_01]  This corner, this other corner may be good because here you can have the good light from

[00:08:023.13 --> 00:08:028.63] [SPEAKER_01]  the window so this leather sofa will shine more and you can have a good feeling when

[00:08:028.63 --> 00:08:030.47] [SPEAKER_01]  you're watching Netflix here.

[00:08:031.37 --> 00:08:036.17] [SPEAKER_02]  But if we move the couch, we also need to think about the pictures.

[00:08:037.01 --> 00:08:042.93] [SPEAKER_02]  Because I don't... I like the pictures there and I don't think it's...

[00:08:042.93 --> 00:08:047.13] [SPEAKER_02]  It's wise to have a couch under there with people having their heads all the time.

[00:08:047.33 --> 00:08:048.01] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, and computers.

[00:08:049.81 --> 00:08:056.33] [SPEAKER_02]  Potentially destroying them. I don't want to. So we should move the pictures if we move the couch.

[00:08:047.00 --> 00:08:048.26] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, I'm sure it's computer.

[00:08:057.73 --> 00:08:058.09] [SPEAKER_02]  Um.

[00:08:059.14 --> 00:09:008.80] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, I think they should be put somewhere else if we if we put the couch here because yes, you said having your

[00:09:008.80 --> 00:09:014.46] [SPEAKER_00]  Heads on them all the times they will fall off the wall and yeah, it's

[00:09:008.73 --> 00:09:009.73] [SPEAKER_01]  I had on my head so...

[00:09:014.39 --> 00:09:019.51] [SPEAKER_01]  Since we are moving the couch, we should not forget about this TV stand.

[00:09:019.73 --> 00:09:026.23] [SPEAKER_01]  We need to rotate a TV stand as well, so there will be the perfect view while watching the TV,

[00:09:026.67 --> 00:09:029.55] [SPEAKER_01]  and the couch should be placed accordingly.

[00:09:030.09 --> 00:09:032.47] [SPEAKER_01]  And we need to rotate a table a little bit.

[00:09:032.49 --> 00:09:035.55] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, that's right. We have to rearrange.

[00:09:036.81 --> 00:09:043.87] [SPEAKER_02]  If we have the couch there and the TV there, we should move the table out of the way.

[00:09:044.71 --> 00:09:048.85] [SPEAKER_02]  More even for the way if you guys want, because I don't like the table.

[00:09:049.03 --> 00:09:050.83] [SPEAKER_02]  It's a bit small and stuff.

[00:09:051.53 --> 00:09:057.49] [SPEAKER_02]  And if we rearrange the couch here and the TV there, I don't know where we should have

[00:09:057.49 --> 00:10:002.03] [SPEAKER_02]  the table that is not in the way of our experience.

[00:10:002.17 --> 00:10:006.89] [SPEAKER_01]  I think we can have our couch there, it's a nice place, and then we can move our table

[00:10:006.89 --> 00:10:012.34] [SPEAKER_01]  in the corner, so it will be the corner, it won't occupy that much space, and then we

[00:10:012.34 --> 00:10:017.10] [SPEAKER_01]  can have the TV, without recording that much, and we can have the TV in the center, or we

[00:10:017.10 --> 00:10:021.48] [SPEAKER_01]  can mount this TV on the wall, that would consume less space, I think.

[00:10:025.95 --> 00:10:026.47] [SPEAKER_02]  I'm sorry, I'm not.

[00:10:026.49 --> 00:10:027.41] [SPEAKER_00]  You can go first.

[00:10:028.11 --> 00:10:030.39] [SPEAKER_00]  And I think the ball bounce is...

[00:10:031.17 --> 00:10:031.97] [SPEAKER_00]  Quite a good idea.

[00:10:032.73 --> 00:10:036.97] [SPEAKER_00]  Well, can't forget that there's some more stuff on the TV.

[00:10:038.07 --> 00:10:039.43] [SPEAKER_00]  But yeah, I would.

[00:10:034.61 --> 00:10:035.75] [SPEAKER_01]  There's some more stuff.

[00:10:041.73 --> 00:10:053.07] [SPEAKER_00]  I want to give you credit for your suggestion to remove the table from the living room.

[00:10:054.15 --> 00:10:055.55] [SPEAKER_00]  There are other rooms maybe.

[00:10:050.86 --> 00:10:051.78] [SPEAKER_01]  remove the table.

[00:11:002.81 --> 00:11:003.87] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, we have to do it.

[00:11:004.50 --> 00:11:005.98] [SPEAKER_02]  should think about that at least.

[00:11:006.20 --> 00:11:008.39] [SPEAKER_02]  That's what I wanted to come back to too.

[00:11:008.58 --> 00:11:013.43] [SPEAKER_02]  Nice that we are on the same page because I think with this table here,

[00:11:013.53 --> 00:11:016.53] [SPEAKER_02]  also in the living room, it's too much big stuff.

[00:11:017.03 --> 00:11:020.88] [SPEAKER_02]  So we clutter the whole thing and nothing looks really that good.

[00:11:021.22 --> 00:11:022.84] [SPEAKER_02]  So I think the table should go.

[00:11:024.01 --> 00:11:032.43] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, let's do that, because as we said, our main point is to have a bit more space here

[00:11:032.43 --> 00:11:036.39] [SPEAKER_00]  and have it a bit more cozy, I think.

[00:11:031.82 --> 00:11:032.03] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah.

[00:11:033.94 --> 00:11:034.34] [SPEAKER_02]  cozy.

[00:11:037.03 --> 00:11:042.01] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah, so we're showing you can move the table in the corner on the other corner of the room

[00:11:042.01 --> 00:11:047.37] [SPEAKER_01]  And we can have our couch here and also there is a Persian rug

[00:11:047.37 --> 00:11:054.01] [SPEAKER_01]  Standing there we can place this beautiful handmade Persian rug in the center between table

[00:11:054.01 --> 00:11:056.57] [SPEAKER_01]  between the tv and the couch

[00:11:056.57 --> 00:11:057.41] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah

[00:11:058.06 --> 00:12:005.80] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, we can do that and look at it if it looks alright and then we can still throw

[00:12:005.80 --> 00:12:009.02] [SPEAKER_02]  stuff away and move stuff around if we need it.

[00:12:009.88 --> 00:12:010.86] [SPEAKER_02]  Does it sound good to you?

[00:12:001.29 --> 00:12:001.73] [SPEAKER_00]  Look at that.

[00:12:010.99 --> 00:12:014.30] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, that's I think that's that's nice

[00:12:014.30 --> 00:12:016.97] [SPEAKER_00]  Do we want to talk about the time?

[00:12:022.05 --> 00:12:024.85] [SPEAKER_02]  I don't know the answer to that.

[00:12:025.97 --> 00:12:026.69] [SPEAKER_02]  Let's just say we're going to have to wait for the next question.

[00:12:025.80 --> 00:12:038.24] [SPEAKER_00]  Let's just say we think about this for a few more days and we can talk next week about

[00:12:038.24 --> 00:12:046.16] [SPEAKER_00]  our time frame just to be sure that everybody's on the same page and everybody slept over

[00:12:046.16 --> 00:12:047.54] [SPEAKER_00]  our ideas now.

[00:12:047.65 --> 00:12:054.61] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, that sounds good. Good idea. And I think we should also have some proposal ready so that we can

[00:12:055.48 --> 00:12:058.08] [SPEAKER_00]  Maybe a small drawing.

[00:12:057.27 --> 00:12:057.91] [SPEAKER_02]  That's my drawing.

[00:13:001.33 --> 00:13:003.37] [SPEAKER_02]  nice so we will come back to this in a week i guess

[00:13:004.08 --> 00:13:007.40] [SPEAKER_01]  Sure, let's meet this week and we can arrange our things.

[00:13:007.96 --> 00:13:008.60] [SPEAKER_01]  Nice, nice.

[00:13:010.82 --> 00:13:013.03] [SPEAKER_02]  I think this was video number two?

[00:13:013.46 --> 00:13:013.46] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:13:013.63 --> 00:13:014.74] [SPEAKER_02]  Or do we need something still?

[00:13:014.98 --> 00:13:015.25] [SPEAKER_02]  No.

[00:13:015.63 --> 00:13:015.86] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay.

[00:13:013.25 --> 00:13:014.73] [SPEAKER_00]  or do we need something else though?

[00:13:015.45 --> 00:13:022.73] [SPEAKER_00]  Okay, nice. I think one or two other questions about the TV has to be reformulated
