[00:00:001.86 --> 00:00:019.24] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay now. So guys, we wanted to move out of the place here but I don't know. I think the place is a bit too loud at the moment and we need a bit...

[00:00:019.24 --> 00:00:027.48] [SPEAKER_02]  It's a bit small for us if we are free here and you know guys girlfriends and stuff.

[00:00:027.67 --> 00:00:034.55] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah, even here the pub is nearby and even on the weekends it's too loud and seems sounds

[00:00:034.55 --> 00:00:037.85] [SPEAKER_01]  crazy sometimes, especially when the football matches.

[00:00:038.95 --> 00:00:043.77] [SPEAKER_01]  And my girlfriend on weekends we try to relax a little bit when we are not going out, so

[00:00:043.77 --> 00:00:045.41] [SPEAKER_01]  I'm also thinking of moving out.

[00:00:045.47 --> 00:00:051.29] [SPEAKER_01]  And yesterday we went out for a walk, we just met our old neighbor and she said yeah there's

[00:00:051.73 --> 00:00:058.41] [SPEAKER_01]  a new area here and the apartments are really nice, they are really cozy, comfortable and

[00:00:058.41 --> 00:00:058.93] [SPEAKER_01]  it's really cool.

[00:00:049.99 --> 00:00:050.89] [SPEAKER_00]  and she said yeah

[00:00:059.16 --> 00:01:006.17] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay, yeah, with our recent pay increase, I think we should look at a bigger place together.

[00:01:006.31 --> 00:01:010.19] [SPEAKER_02]  Or if you guys want to move in together, yeah.

[00:01:011.78 --> 00:01:015.76] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, yeah, I'm completely with you on this.

[00:01:016.48 --> 00:01:023.94] [SPEAKER_00]  Just hearing the street noise at the moment makes me want to move out.

[00:01:024.02 --> 00:01:027.74] [SPEAKER_00]  And I'm really glad that now we have the opportunity.

[00:01:029.14 --> 00:01:030.72] [SPEAKER_00]  That's nice.

[00:01:031.02 --> 00:01:032.02] [SPEAKER_00]  But I think we have.

[00:01:015.83 --> 00:01:016.15] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah.

[00:01:024.27 --> 00:01:025.33] [SPEAKER_02]  Really glad that's...

[00:01:028.18 --> 00:01:028.36] [SPEAKER_02]  Mm-hmm.

[00:01:034.80 --> 00:01:045.28] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, we have to discuss who does what in this moving process because, yeah, there's

[00:01:045.28 --> 00:01:047.23] [SPEAKER_00]  the possibility of doing everything ourselves.

[00:01:047.38 --> 00:01:047.73] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah.

[00:01:047.73 --> 00:01:051.95] [SPEAKER_00]  This would be a bit cheaper, but also obviously way more expensive.

[00:01:035.28 --> 00:01:036.02] [SPEAKER_01]  We have to discuss.

[00:01:040.73 --> 00:01:040.75] [SPEAKER_02]  We

[00:01:047.33 --> 00:01:047.63] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah.

[00:01:052.60 --> 00:02:001.10] [SPEAKER_02]  But we have many friends and maybe we can get them together and just take the stuff and move.

[00:02:002.00 --> 00:02:007.28] [SPEAKER_02]  And we just lend us a truck or something and move with them.

[00:02:005.14 --> 00:02:005.44] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah.

[00:02:007.40 --> 00:02:014.12] [SPEAKER_01]  Well, I have a good idea and the idea is when I used to live in the student dormitory

[00:02:014.12 --> 00:02:021.72] [SPEAKER_01]  one year ago with many of my friends and there I was helping them in shifting their stuff,

[00:02:021.78 --> 00:02:026.38] [SPEAKER_01]  in moving out and when they are getting new appliances or anything. So they are also up for

[00:02:026.38 --> 00:02:035.28] [SPEAKER_01]  me to help here in moving out all the stuff and also there is a good idea we can have a small

[00:02:036.12 --> 00:02:042.28] [SPEAKER_01]  together or like a party we can have the food and drinks here and like at the end of the party

[00:02:042.28 --> 00:02:047.24] [SPEAKER_01]  we can take help from our friend and they can also help us in moving out. What do you guys think?

[00:02:047.70 --> 00:02:048.64] [SPEAKER_01]  I think it sounds good.

[00:02:048.44 --> 00:02:048.46] [SPEAKER_00]  Good.

[00:02:049.50 --> 00:02:053.90] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, I think the idea with a party sounds really, really good.

[00:02:055.06 --> 00:03:002.40] [SPEAKER_00]  But to be totally honest, I'm not that keen on doing everything myself,

[00:03:002.54 --> 00:03:009.02] [SPEAKER_00]  especially when we are talking about all this stuff around us, which is quite large.

[00:03:009.60 --> 00:03:016.42] [SPEAKER_00]  And I have a friend from school who works at a company who helps with moving out.

[00:03:018.02 --> 00:03:027.00] [SPEAKER_00]  I'd say this would be quite an opportunity to use some of our newfound money

[00:03:027.00 --> 00:03:030.04] [SPEAKER_00]  and make our lives a bit easier.

[00:03:031.30 --> 00:03:035.02] [SPEAKER_00]  There will be enough work even when contracting a company.

[00:03:035.86 --> 00:03:040.06] [SPEAKER_00]  And as I heard, they are not that expensive to be totally honest.

[00:03:017.85 --> 00:03:017.85] [SPEAKER_02] 

[00:03:041.17 --> 00:03:047.07] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay, yeah, if we all pitch in together and your friends give us a little discount, I

[00:03:047.07 --> 00:03:049.07] [SPEAKER_02]  would say it's okay.

[00:03:049.69 --> 00:03:052.05] [SPEAKER_02]  I would be okay with the company.

[00:03:052.63 --> 00:03:052.93] [SPEAKER_02]  You, George?

[00:03:053.34 --> 00:04:000.56] [SPEAKER_01]  I think it will be okay or we can save our money instead of spending it on the moving

[00:04:000.56 --> 00:04:006.76] [SPEAKER_01]  out we can take help from the fence and we can buy some new appliances with this money

[00:04:006.76 --> 00:04:011.10] [SPEAKER_01]  instead of spending it on the move out with the company.

[00:04:011.88 --> 00:04:012.76] [SPEAKER_01]  What do you guys think?

[00:04:011.74 --> 00:04:012.68] [SPEAKER_00]  What do you guys think?

[00:04:014.85 --> 00:04:020.87] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, we could do this, but I'm still for the company.

[00:04:021.53 --> 00:04:023.55] [SPEAKER_00]  And as I said, it's not that expensive.

[00:04:025.24 --> 00:04:039.14] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, so that's I think let's go with the company but we can come back to this later after we talk about the stuff in the living room and how we want to process this.

[00:04:040.66 --> 00:04:044.02] [SPEAKER_02]  So yeah, I want to take.

[00:04:034.60 --> 00:04:034.88] [SPEAKER_00]  Mm-hmm.

[00:04:045.09 --> 00:04:047.05] [SPEAKER_02]  I don't want to take the couch.

[00:04:048.41 --> 00:04:049.85] [SPEAKER_02]  This big old thing.

[00:04:050.93 --> 00:04:053.93] [SPEAKER_02]  I think it's too big for our new apartment.

[00:04:054.79 --> 00:04:056.31] [SPEAKER_02]  It's old guys.

[00:04:056.57 --> 00:04:057.13] [SPEAKER_02]  I don't know.

[00:04:058.01 --> 00:05:000.97] [SPEAKER_02]  I'm against taking it with us.

[00:05:002.00 --> 00:05:007.94] [SPEAKER_01]  This is a leather couch. The quality is really good and it's really really cozy and comfortable

[00:05:007.94 --> 00:05:014.10] [SPEAKER_01]  Especially in winters when we are watching Netflix with my girlfriend. It's really incredible thing

[00:05:014.10 --> 00:05:018.76] [SPEAKER_01]  I don't think it's a good idea to move this couch away

[00:05:018.76 --> 00:05:021.68] [SPEAKER_01]  Okay, I'm going to really nice. I liked it

[00:05:023.03 --> 00:05:023.75] [SPEAKER_00]  I don't know.

[00:05:023.99 --> 00:05:025.39] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, I agree with George.

[00:05:027.27 --> 00:05:031.19] [SPEAKER_00]  I also think we should take the couch with us

[00:05:031.19 --> 00:05:031.93] [SPEAKER_00]  to the new flat.

[00:05:033.51 --> 00:05:037.49] [SPEAKER_00]  But yeah, we have to think about getting it out

[00:05:037.49 --> 00:05:040.25] [SPEAKER_00]  of this building because last year the main entrance,

[00:05:040.67 --> 00:05:043.25] [SPEAKER_00]  as you know, was redone.

[00:05:043.41 --> 00:05:044.95] [SPEAKER_00]  And I think the new door is...

[00:05:048.74 --> 00:05:057.86] [SPEAKER_00]  getting the couch in last time. So maybe we have to measure it but yeah the

[00:05:057.86 --> 00:06:003.10] [SPEAKER_00]  company could help us with that and there must be a way to get this couch out of this building.

[00:06:004.82 --> 00:06:007.94] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah so I think we should take it with us.

[00:05:058.99 --> 00:05:058.99] [SPEAKER_01] 

[00:06:000.88 --> 00:06:000.88] [SPEAKER_01] 

[00:06:008.25 --> 00:06:013.65] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay, if you guys get it all of the apartment, you can have it.

[00:06:014.67 --> 00:06:020.62] [SPEAKER_01]  I really want to have this couch. I have some really good memories with this couch also my dog

[00:06:020.62 --> 00:06:025.85] [SPEAKER_01]  Which died last month it also used to sit with me in this couch in the winter

[00:06:025.85 --> 00:06:031.20] [SPEAKER_01]  So I have really good memories with this leather couch and I don't want to throw this away at any cost

[00:06:031.20 --> 00:06:035.50] [SPEAKER_01]  Also, I think this big window in the room

[00:06:035.50 --> 00:06:040.94] [SPEAKER_01]  It can also be used to take couch out if it is not

[00:06:040.94 --> 00:06:043.52] [SPEAKER_01]  possible to take it out with the

[00:06:044.17 --> 00:06:048.31] [SPEAKER_01]  Door, but I think so. Yeah, we want to keep this couch. Okay, we'll get it done

[00:06:048.82 --> 00:06:049.69] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, okay.

[00:06:049.88 --> 00:06:050.56] [SPEAKER_02]  No problem.

[00:06:050.87 --> 00:06:051.14] [SPEAKER_02]  Should.

[00:06:052.50 --> 00:06:053.35] [SPEAKER_02]  If you guys can do it.

[00:06:055.93 --> 00:07:006.23] [SPEAKER_00]  Okay. Yeah, if we talk about moving, you know my problem with your color choices, George,

[00:07:006.40 --> 00:07:016.61] [SPEAKER_00]  I think we have to talk about your chair you often sit in and the planting pots next to it.

[00:07:017.31 --> 00:07:020.38] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, I don't think that, yeah I know, and that are

[00:07:021.72 --> 00:07:024.78] [SPEAKER_01]  Well, we cannot throw everything out.

[00:07:025.14 --> 00:07:028.06] [SPEAKER_01]  You cannot like throw everything out.

[00:07:028.22 --> 00:07:032.30] [SPEAKER_01]  The thing is this chair was from my late grandma

[00:07:032.30 --> 00:07:034.66] [SPEAKER_01]  and also from my great grandma.

[00:07:035.12 --> 00:07:038.80] [SPEAKER_01]  They all used to sit on this chair, read stories,

[00:07:038.92 --> 00:07:042.18] [SPEAKER_01]  and I grew up listening all the stories from her.

[00:07:042.26 --> 00:07:044.28] [SPEAKER_01]  And I all the time keep this chair with me.

[00:07:044.28 --> 00:07:046.08] [SPEAKER_01]  So I cannot throw this chair.

[00:07:046.66 --> 00:07:048.62] [SPEAKER_01]  Of course, the color is a little bit old,

[00:07:048.62 --> 00:07:051.60] [SPEAKER_01]  but the memories are really precious for me.

[00:07:051.66 --> 00:07:055.10] [SPEAKER_01]  So I cannot just throw this chair.

[00:07:056.32 --> 00:07:058.90] [SPEAKER_01]  And also these plants, they are really good.

[00:07:059.18 --> 00:08:002.04] [SPEAKER_01]  And this pot, it is basically a Chinese pot.

[00:08:002.52 --> 00:08:006.16] [SPEAKER_01]  And when some of our known person,

[00:08:007.34 --> 00:08:009.92] [SPEAKER_01]  especially my dog, which died last month,

[00:08:010.50 --> 00:08:013.26] [SPEAKER_01]  his ashes are still there in that Chinese pot.

[00:08:013.58 --> 00:08:015.38] [SPEAKER_01]  So I don't want to throw it.

[00:08:015.99 --> 00:08:022.25] [SPEAKER_02]  Anyway, okay, but if you can have your plants in your chair, I want some paintings for the

[00:08:022.25 --> 00:08:028.35] [SPEAKER_02]  walls because I think they're looking a bit dull at the moment with well when they are

[00:08:028.35 --> 00:08:028.95] [SPEAKER_02]  so empty.

[00:08:029.43 --> 00:08:029.99] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah.

[00:08:030.44 --> 00:08:039.04] [SPEAKER_01]  Sure, I know one of my friends and she owes me something and she is a really good painter.

[00:08:039.42 --> 00:08:042.80] [SPEAKER_01]  She has a good gallery.

[00:08:046.06 --> 00:08:052.38] [SPEAKER_02]  Does she do big pictures? Because I think we should have some big pictures on the walls

[00:08:052.38 --> 00:08:055.50] [SPEAKER_02]  and just try to make it a bit more lively.

[00:08:055.94 --> 00:09:001.70] [SPEAKER_01]  Yes of course, she does everything with the small and the big and the medium sized paintings

[00:09:001.70 --> 00:09:008.36] [SPEAKER_01]  and she's really good with this fine art stuff so we can have a walk in the evening and we

[00:09:008.36 --> 00:09:009.68] [SPEAKER_01]  can visit her gallery.

[00:09:010.06 --> 00:09:011.28] [SPEAKER_01]  That would be interesting.

[00:09:012.18 --> 00:09:014.54] [SPEAKER_02]  the prices aren't too high with her.

[00:09:015.85 --> 00:09:021.03] [SPEAKER_01]  The prices are are okay, but she owes me some debt because

[00:09:021.03 --> 00:09:028.95] [SPEAKER_01]  Sometimes a few months ago. She needs some money and I just helped her and she said I can

[00:09:028.95 --> 00:09:034.83] [SPEAKER_01]  Have anything from her gallery anytime if I like so I think we can go there and she's a good friend of mine

[00:09:034.83 --> 00:09:040.83] [SPEAKER_01]  Her name is antonia. We met at this salsa dance in the

[00:09:040.83 --> 00:09:045.81] [SPEAKER_01]  In our university and we have sometimes really good family terms as well

[00:09:046.21 --> 00:09:049.63] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah, so I think we can go there. It's no problem

[00:09:049.86 --> 00:09:055.74] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay, if you are willing to get me a picture of this would be nice.

[00:09:056.00 --> 00:09:056.76] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you, George.

[00:09:057.02 --> 00:09:057.20] [SPEAKER_00]  Sure.

[00:09:057.80 --> 00:10:001.30] [SPEAKER_00]  Would Antonia also be able to help us with moving?

[00:10:001.79 --> 00:10:007.51] [SPEAKER_01]  Of course, while she was setting up her gallery, I went there to help her setting up stuff

[00:10:007.51 --> 00:10:009.93] [SPEAKER_01]  and putting all the things together.

[00:10:010.49 --> 00:10:013.69] [SPEAKER_01]  So yeah, she's a really good person and she will definitely help us.

[00:10:014.27 --> 00:10:015.39] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay, nice, nice.

[00:10:015.15 --> 00:10:016.75] [SPEAKER_01]  Nice. We can count on her.

[00:10:019.51 --> 00:10:022.93] [SPEAKER_02]  So we have a couch, what about a new table?

[00:10:023.67 --> 00:10:029.51] [SPEAKER_01]  I will bring the new table. I have a good idea the place where we want to move in.

[00:10:030.39 --> 00:10:034.17] [SPEAKER_01]  When I met my our last neighbor her name was

[00:10:034.17 --> 00:10:036.81] [SPEAKER_01]  Mrs. Malta and I

[00:10:036.81 --> 00:10:042.65] [SPEAKER_01]  actually she showed me the building. I have seen this building and I want to get in this

[00:10:042.65 --> 00:10:045.13] [SPEAKER_01]  Table. The table is a little bit big

[00:10:045.48 --> 00:10:045.70] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay.

[00:10:045.88 --> 00:10:053.30] [SPEAKER_01]  as compared to the one which we had right now and this table will help a lot in arranging party

[00:10:053.30 --> 00:11:001.64] [SPEAKER_01]  getting all the stuff together and we can have we can gather many guests dinner on that table yeah

[00:11:001.64 --> 00:11:006.18] [SPEAKER_01]  i think i can bring this table okay yeah George new table sounds nice but

[00:11:003.45 --> 00:11:010.61] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay, yeah, the watch table sounds nice, but...

[00:11:010.61 --> 00:11:012.15] [SPEAKER_02]  I forgot what I wanted to say.

[00:11:012.59 --> 00:11:013.25] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, no problem.

[00:11:013.65 --> 00:11:014.65] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, I also think...

[00:11:012.41 --> 00:11:020.43] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, no problem. Yeah, I also think a new table is a really good idea, especially considering that

[00:11:020.43 --> 00:11:029.25] [SPEAKER_00]  sitting at this table with three persons, it's almost full. So yeah, when we want to have guests

[00:11:029.25 --> 00:11:037.01] [SPEAKER_00]  over, it would be really nice to have a table which is a bit bigger at least.

[00:11:037.27 --> 00:11:037.69] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, and also,

[00:11:037.01 --> 00:11:046.03] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah, also this table which I have seen it's really cool. It has like you can also play a poker on the table.

[00:11:046.41 --> 00:11:055.75] [SPEAKER_01]  You can just swap the top and from the below you can have this poker table stuff pop up.

[00:11:055.75 --> 00:11:058.77] [SPEAKER_01]  So it's really incredible. I think you guys will be happy with it.

[00:11:058.81 --> 00:11:059.41] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah, sounds like.

[00:11:059.44 --> 00:12:004.56] [SPEAKER_02]  fantastic table. So let's go with that. So we throw out this table.

[00:12:004.82 --> 00:12:009.34] [SPEAKER_02]  We don't need it anymore. Okay. Easier to move. Yes.

[00:12:009.50 --> 00:12:009.52] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah.

[00:12:011.22 --> 00:12:013.96] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, I just remembered.

[00:12:015.60 --> 00:12:022.96] [SPEAKER_00]  Like you showed, the Persian rug, we bought at an auction last year.

[00:12:023.72 --> 00:12:028.04] [SPEAKER_00]  Since then, as we all knew, it gets us dust in the corner.

[00:12:028.32 --> 00:12:030.24] [SPEAKER_00]  But you were so excited for it.

[00:12:030.52 --> 00:12:037.06] [SPEAKER_00]  I still think it's really beautiful, but it doesn't fit in this living room at the moment.

[00:12:038.16 --> 00:12:042.90] [SPEAKER_00]  Maybe we should try to fit it into the new one.

[00:12:043.16 --> 00:12:049.52] [SPEAKER_00]  We have to talk about rugs and the floor in general anyway.

[00:12:050.82 --> 00:12:058.22] [SPEAKER_00]  But to be really clear, I think the Persian rug should be used in the new flat.

[00:12:042.94 --> 00:12:043.28] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah

[00:12:048.46 --> 00:12:048.72] [SPEAKER_01]  Anyway.

[00:12:058.45 --> 00:13:004.35] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, I think it's better than gathering dust in the corner, so I think we will take the

[00:13:004.35 --> 00:13:005.19] [SPEAKER_02]  Perl and Ruff burgers.

[00:13:005.71 --> 00:13:005.93] [SPEAKER_02]  Sure.

[00:13:006.79 --> 00:13:010.15] [SPEAKER_02]  But how do you guys want to do the move?

[00:13:010.53 --> 00:13:018.31] [SPEAKER_02]  Do you guys want to do it all the time or because I think we should do a week or so

[00:13:018.31 --> 00:13:021.95] [SPEAKER_02]  leave and just do it in one clean swoop in that time?

[00:13:022.45 --> 00:13:030.63] [SPEAKER_01]  Well, I have one I can take one day off from my company and they have this move out

[00:13:030.63 --> 00:13:037.09] [SPEAKER_01]  vacation plan so I can take that one and in a whole week we can gradually pack all stuff we

[00:13:037.09 --> 00:13:043.79] [SPEAKER_01]  can accommodate stuff our stuff nearly in the basement so we can take heavy stuff on weekends

[00:13:043.79 --> 00:13:047.25] [SPEAKER_01]  and then we can do this gradually what what do you think check

[00:13:048.39 --> 00:14:000.32] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, I agree with Harry on this one. I think we should take a full week and just get it over with.

[00:14:001.41 --> 00:14:010.24] [SPEAKER_00]  Even when contracting a company, it's so much work. We only talked about furniture up to this point, but to be totally honest,

[00:13:055.66 --> 00:13:056.08] [SPEAKER_01]  for me.

[00:14:014.49 --> 00:14:022.75] [SPEAKER_00]  Everything has to be packed in boxes and the boxes have to be transported and then everything

[00:14:022.75 --> 00:14:025.95] [SPEAKER_00]  has to be put to its new place.

[00:14:026.33 --> 00:14:027.45] [SPEAKER_00]  So I think in other words, we have to be very careful.

[00:14:017.88 --> 00:14:018.90] [SPEAKER_01]  boxes and

[00:14:029.09 --> 00:14:040.53] [SPEAKER_00]  won't be possible and yeah after work if we do this gradually after work I think this would not do us good.

[00:14:040.93 --> 00:14:048.43] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, I think so too. If we do it just gradually, we will take a long time and we are already exhausted when we come home from work.

[00:14:049.07 --> 00:14:056.15] [SPEAKER_02]  And I think if we just do it in one fell swoop, George, we can, we have a much better time with it in the end.

[00:14:056.44 --> 00:15:003.28] [SPEAKER_01]  Well, these all things are your things, so you guys know how you can manage it.

[00:15:003.56 --> 00:15:010.12] [SPEAKER_01]  We can start packing now in the cartons and you can start gathering your things.

[00:15:010.22 --> 00:15:013.64] [SPEAKER_01]  I think it will be easy to do it in one sweep.

[00:15:015.27 --> 00:15:025.83] [SPEAKER_02]  Okay, nice. So guys, I think we do it as we said in one week and it should go out smoothly.

[00:15:027.52 --> 00:15:031.28] [SPEAKER_02]  You will talk to the company again.

[00:15:031.28 --> 00:15:031.76] [SPEAKER_02]  Yes, I will.

[00:15:032.50 --> 00:15:038.04] [SPEAKER_02]  So, and we try to get a new table and stuff.

[00:15:039.00 --> 00:15:039.33] [SPEAKER_02]  Sure, okay.

[00:15:039.52 --> 00:15:042.74] [SPEAKER_01]  And please don't forget the Persian Rukh. It's really expensive.

[00:15:041.89 --> 00:15:046.03] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, it was too expensive and handmade.

[00:15:047.50 --> 00:15:049.26] [SPEAKER_00]  how could we forget the Pajaruk?

[00:15:049.41 --> 00:15:049.71] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah.

[00:15:051.59 --> 00:15:051.97] [SPEAKER_02]  Nice.
