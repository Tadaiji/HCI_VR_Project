[00:00:004.10 --> 00:00:004.42] [SPEAKER_04]  Okay.

[00:00:004.36 --> 00:00:005.74] [SPEAKER_04]  All right, good to go.

[00:00:005.84 --> 00:00:006.84] [SPEAKER_04]  You wanna lead us off, John?

[00:00:006.94 --> 00:00:007.72] [SPEAKER_04]  I think you have the first item.

[00:00:008.16 --> 00:00:013.66] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, thanks, Dan. So hey, welcome, everybody. Would like to give Nico a warm welcome. Nico is

[00:00:013.66 --> 00:00:019.26] [SPEAKER_02]  joining us today as a new front-end engineer on the package team. We're very excited to have you,

[00:00:019.36 --> 00:00:024.12] [SPEAKER_02]  Nico. Nico, I know you just did this, but would you mind just giving us a real quick snippet about

[00:00:024.12 --> 00:00:024.68] [SPEAKER_02]  yourself?

[00:00:025.10 --> 00:00:026.34] [SPEAKER_03]  Sure, not a problem.

[00:00:027.66 --> 00:00:028.10] [SPEAKER_03]  So I'm Nico.

[00:00:028.28 --> 00:00:030.54] [SPEAKER_03]  My name is Nicolo, but Nico is perfect for everybody.

[00:00:033.30 --> 00:00:035.42] [SPEAKER_03]  Before Github, I was working in PuiLab,

[00:00:035.70 --> 00:00:037.92] [SPEAKER_03]  so I guess Lapa sticks with me.

[00:00:038.96 --> 00:00:042.98] [SPEAKER_03]  I'm really in love with UJS, and I maintain some open source

[00:00:042.98 --> 00:00:044.84] [SPEAKER_03]  packages, and I'm really excited to start.

[00:00:046.52 --> 00:00:048.48] [SPEAKER_02]  Mika, we are super excited you're here.

[00:00:048.81 --> 00:00:050.34] [SPEAKER_02]  Thank you for that and welcome.

[00:00:051.23 --> 00:00:051.45] [SPEAKER_02]  Awesome.

[00:00:052.09 --> 00:00:052.63] [SPEAKER_02]  Thanks, Dan.

[00:00:052.70 --> 00:00:053.23] [SPEAKER_02]  Over to you.

[00:00:053.89 --> 00:00:054.69] [SPEAKER_04]  Welcome, Nico.

[00:00:054.95 --> 00:00:056.63] [SPEAKER_04]  It's great to have you on the team.

[00:00:058.01 --> 00:01:000.53] [SPEAKER_04]  And next item was issue herder for doing

[00:01:000.53 --> 00:01:002.47] [SPEAKER_04]  async issue weight estimates.

[00:01:003.09 --> 00:01:007.53] [SPEAKER_04]  So we've been walking through adding to our very lightweight

[00:01:007.53 --> 00:01:009.33] [SPEAKER_04]  process as we need to add it.

[00:01:009.63 --> 00:01:011.17] [SPEAKER_04]  As we're seeing gaps, the plan is

[00:01:011.17 --> 00:01:013.45] [SPEAKER_04]  to do as little effort as we can and then

[00:01:013.45 --> 00:01:014.43] [SPEAKER_04]  just start working on things.

[00:01:014.69 --> 00:01:017.67] [SPEAKER_04]  And as we see gaps, we're going to start adding processes

[00:01:017.67 --> 00:01:019.85] [SPEAKER_04]  if we feel like they're necessary.

[00:01:020.49 --> 00:01:022.77] [SPEAKER_04]  Recently, we agreed to do sort of t-shirt sizing

[00:01:022.77 --> 00:01:026.35] [SPEAKER_04]  on all issues that was going to happen the day before the 17th

[00:01:026.35 --> 00:01:027.89] [SPEAKER_04]  to the 16th.

[00:01:027.97 --> 00:01:029.87] [SPEAKER_04]  And we're going to finalize what's

[00:01:029.87 --> 00:01:031.91] [SPEAKER_04]  deliverable on the 17th before we actually

[00:01:031.91 --> 00:01:034.05] [SPEAKER_04]  keep off work on the 18th of our new milestones.

[00:01:035.69 --> 00:01:037.41] [SPEAKER_04]  I would like to see everyone's feedback,

[00:01:037.41 --> 00:01:042.73] [SPEAKER_04]  and I see people have already commented in the agenda.

[00:01:043.03 --> 00:01:044.91] [SPEAKER_04]  But I think what we want to do is

[00:01:044.91 --> 00:01:046.83] [SPEAKER_04]  to decide if we feel like this is helpful.

[00:01:047.15 --> 00:01:049.03] [SPEAKER_04]  Happy to wait for the next milestone

[00:01:049.03 --> 00:01:051.89] [SPEAKER_04]  to see if people are really concerned about the way

[00:01:051.89 --> 00:01:056.23] [SPEAKER_04]  we decided to already do the lightweight issue waiting

[00:01:056.23 --> 00:01:057.27] [SPEAKER_04]  effort that we have.

[00:01:057.87 --> 00:02:000.45] [SPEAKER_04]  I prefer to iterate on things and not just

[00:02:000.45 --> 00:02:002.85] [SPEAKER_04]  add a whole bunch of process unless there's a clear reason

[00:02:002.85 --> 00:02:003.75] [SPEAKER_04]  why we're adding it.

[00:02:003.77 --> 00:02:005.79] [SPEAKER_04]  And that's kind of why I'm sort of saying, hey,

[00:02:005.79 --> 00:02:006.95] [SPEAKER_04]  go take a look at this tool.

[00:02:007.07 --> 00:02:009.95] [SPEAKER_04]  John's used it so John can answer questions better

[00:02:009.95 --> 00:02:012.21] [SPEAKER_04]  than I can with the issue header.

[00:02:012.79 --> 00:02:015.23] [SPEAKER_04]  And so yeah, just flag that for everyone.

[00:02:015.33 --> 00:02:016.25] [SPEAKER_04]  Go take a look at that tool.

[00:02:016.31 --> 00:02:019.47] [SPEAKER_04]  If you don't have access, Darby or myself,

[00:02:019.87 --> 00:02:022.71] [SPEAKER_04]  I have to reach out to Darby for people if I need to.

[00:02:024.87 --> 00:02:025.15] [SPEAKER_04]  Cool.

[00:02:025.67 --> 00:02:028.25] [SPEAKER_04]  I think you have the next item as well.

[00:02:029.81 --> 00:02:032.37] [SPEAKER_04]  And if people want to discuss that further,

[00:02:032.65 --> 00:02:034.83] [SPEAKER_04]  just sort of issue header further.

[00:02:035.41 --> 00:02:037.33] [SPEAKER_04]  Just sort of hit up John and Package Channel.

[00:02:037.79 --> 00:02:039.29] [SPEAKER_04]  He said he'd do a demo for us.

[00:02:039.57 --> 00:02:040.55] [SPEAKER_04]  Do you have the next item, John?

[00:02:041.27 --> 00:02:048.65] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, thanks, Dan. Yeah, please reach out for issue herder. I can give you a walkthrough of how, why we built it, what it does, all that good stuff.

[00:02:049.91 --> 00:02:059.95] [SPEAKER_02]  Next point is just a silly Chuck or a silly point we're saying hi to Chuck. Chuck is a good friend who's been sometimes follows our meetings on YouTube. So, hi Chuck.

[00:03:003.09 --> 00:03:005.03] [SPEAKER_02]  Over to Steve. Thanks, everybody.

[00:03:006.78 --> 00:03:010.60] [SPEAKER_01]  Uh, yeah, I was just thinking, or the last week to realize that, um,

[00:03:010.68 --> 00:03:014.10] [SPEAKER_01]  some of us might have daylight savings coming up and realize that maybe not all

[00:03:014.10 --> 00:03:014.98] [SPEAKER_01]  of ours line up.

[00:03:015.02 --> 00:03:020.16] [SPEAKER_01]  So, um, thought it'd be maybe a good idea to know when that might happen for some

[00:03:020.16 --> 00:03:024.48] [SPEAKER_01]  people and whether or not that affects any of these meeting times in any

[00:03:024.48 --> 00:03:025.44] [SPEAKER_01]  particular way.

[00:03:025.88 --> 00:03:030.40] [SPEAKER_01]  Um, but it looks like some people have started to just post their dates and

[00:03:030.40 --> 00:03:034.82] [SPEAKER_01]  just something to keep in mind as we kind of reach the end of October in a

[00:03:034.82 --> 00:03:035.28] [SPEAKER_01]  month or so.

[00:03:037.26 --> 00:03:045.26] [SPEAKER_04]  Cool. Yeah, good call out Steve. Thanks for that. Nice job. I will add mine as well. People want

[00:03:045.26 --> 00:03:050.36] [SPEAKER_04]  to go through and add that to the agenda. I mean, it will just happen with our meetings and everything

[00:03:050.36 --> 00:03:055.18] [SPEAKER_04]  in terms of them sliding, but they won't move automatically. So it's a good, it's a really good

[00:03:055.18 --> 00:04:000.32] [SPEAKER_04]  point. We do have async meetings for a reason. So if they turn into a time that doesn't work

[00:04:000.32 --> 00:04:005.72] [SPEAKER_04]  for people, then we should be able to attend as best as we can with the meeting notes and then

[00:04:005.72 --> 00:04:010.38] [SPEAKER_04]  watching the meeting. Just for anyone that can't make a meeting, just as a friendly reminder that

[00:04:010.38 --> 00:04:016.24] [SPEAKER_04]  you should consider that meeting the next day that you're available or working. You should consider

[00:04:016.24 --> 00:04:021.92] [SPEAKER_04]  that a meeting that you watch as your meeting and take that time, 30 minutes or whatever it is,

[00:04:021.94 --> 00:04:026.70] [SPEAKER_04]  25 minutes to sit down and actually review what's in the agenda and then what actually happened in

[00:04:026.70 --> 00:04:031.36] [SPEAKER_04]  the call. Just because if you don't, you're just going to lose connection with what's happening in

[00:04:031.36 --> 00:04:038.18] [SPEAKER_04]  team. And that's why we have the async setup. So, okay. And the next item is mine.

[00:04:039.76 --> 00:04:045.26] [SPEAKER_04]  There's a discussion that I linked to here of going around iterating on our infrared dev

[00:04:045.26 --> 00:04:052.32] [SPEAKER_04]  escalation process to remove the weekend on call element of that for now. There are a lot of,

[00:04:052.38 --> 00:04:058.24] [SPEAKER_04]  if you look through that thread, hi Tim. If you look through that thread, you'll find that

[00:04:058.24 --> 00:05:003.22] [SPEAKER_04]  the initial issue was raised to say, hey, let's iterate and remove this because there are a bunch

[00:05:003.22 --> 00:05:008.80] [SPEAKER_04]  of actual legal considerations around people working on weekends in some countries without

[00:05:008.80 --> 00:05:013.98] [SPEAKER_04]  being paid. And so there's a lot of considerations to the iteration that are being proposed is to

[00:05:013.98 --> 00:05:020.24] [SPEAKER_04]  remove the weekend element of on call, which might make some people feel a little happier

[00:05:020.24 --> 00:05:022.78] [SPEAKER_04]  because they don't have to be on call on weekends. But

[00:04:053.83 --> 00:04:053.98] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you.

[00:05:023.67 --> 00:05:026.19] [SPEAKER_04]  I don't blame people for feeling happier that way.

[00:05:027.39 --> 00:05:029.33] [SPEAKER_04]  So go check that out if you're interested.

[00:05:029.75 --> 00:05:031.89] [SPEAKER_04]  Don't spend a heap of time on it, but there's already

[00:05:031.89 --> 00:05:034.53] [SPEAKER_04]  a consensus by the look of it that we may be pulling

[00:05:034.53 --> 00:05:036.41] [SPEAKER_04]  the weekend on call out.

[00:05:038.65 --> 00:05:045.59] [SPEAKER_04]  And then we're looking at the next item I had

[00:05:045.59 --> 00:05:050.11] [SPEAKER_04]  was the way to move forward on the community contribution

[00:05:051.29 --> 00:05:053.83] [SPEAKER_04]  for Composer, which is the PHP package manager.

[00:05:054.85 --> 00:05:058.03] [SPEAKER_04]  Gigi's taken a look at that, and I did see a massive commit

[00:05:058.03 --> 00:05:059.61] [SPEAKER_04]  going to that over the weekend.

[00:06:000.41 --> 00:06:004.45] [SPEAKER_04]  So many, so many commits, just like, huge emails.

[00:06:004.71 --> 00:06:005.95] [SPEAKER_04]  So maybe that's going to start moving.

[00:06:006.17 --> 00:06:008.63] [SPEAKER_04]  I'm following that MR so that I can get notifications

[00:06:008.63 --> 00:06:010.25] [SPEAKER_04]  when stuff happens on it, because I really

[00:06:010.25 --> 00:06:012.53] [SPEAKER_04]  would love to see that move forward,

[00:06:012.59 --> 00:06:015.99] [SPEAKER_04]  because when the community spends time contributing,

[00:06:016.03 --> 00:06:018.25] [SPEAKER_04]  it's obviously important that we support them

[00:06:018.25 --> 00:06:019.31] [SPEAKER_04]  as best as we can.

[00:06:019.61 --> 00:06:023.05] [SPEAKER_04]  So I feel like that one's pretty well answered so far.

[00:06:024.11 --> 00:06:025.13] [SPEAKER_04]  And on to you, Axel.

[00:06:026.55 --> 00:06:044.03] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, thanks. So on Friday, I put together a merge request about improving the navigation of the package features. So right now, they are all under one roof because before they were scheduled all over the place. So I think this is going to improve things as Tim suggested.

[00:06:045.81 --> 00:06:053.91] [SPEAKER_00]  And I bring the issue, the merge request and the review app if you want to check it out and leave some feedback. I don't know. So yeah.

[00:06:055.11 --> 00:06:055.51] [SPEAKER_00]  That's it from me.

[00:06:056.80 --> 00:07:001.60] [SPEAKER_04]  That's great. Thank you very much for that Axel and welcome to, I think the first meeting you've been to.

[00:07:001.62 --> 00:07:001.94] [SPEAKER_04]  Yep.

[00:07:003.44 --> 00:07:006.10] [SPEAKER_04]  It's nice to have you here. Welcome.

[00:07:006.30 --> 00:07:006.48] [SPEAKER_04]  Yeah.

[00:07:006.12 --> 00:07:006.12] [SPEAKER_00] 

[00:07:008.94 --> 00:07:012.18] [SPEAKER_04]  And then I have the last thing.

[00:07:012.80 --> 00:07:016.00] [SPEAKER_04]  There is a backend weekly call that goes on.

[00:07:016.20 --> 00:07:019.18] [SPEAKER_04]  It's tomorrow morning, my time, which is UTC minus seven.

[00:07:019.34 --> 00:07:021.28] [SPEAKER_04]  If you look at the team meetings,

[00:07:021.42 --> 00:07:023.20] [SPEAKER_04]  you'll actually be able to find that.

[00:07:023.50 --> 00:07:027.44] [SPEAKER_04]  And this is mostly for you, Steve and Gigi,

[00:07:027.50 --> 00:07:028.92] [SPEAKER_04]  as Gigi is watching this.

[00:07:028.96 --> 00:07:030.00] [SPEAKER_04]  Hi, Gigi.

[00:07:032.18 --> 00:07:033.74] [SPEAKER_04]  Just go check that meeting out.

[00:07:033.74 --> 00:07:037.62] [SPEAKER_04]  It's worth going to Tim Zalman,

[00:07:037.74 --> 00:07:038.78] [SPEAKER_04]  raise this with me,

[00:07:038.90 --> 00:07:040.82] [SPEAKER_04]  that we should be thinking about investing in that.

[00:07:040.90 --> 00:07:043.30] [SPEAKER_04]  And they're gonna start broadening the scope of it.

[00:07:043.54 --> 00:07:046.00] [SPEAKER_04]  Hopefully to perhaps be maybe something that's like,

[00:07:046.24 --> 00:07:047.20] [SPEAKER_04]  ah, here's some tips and tricks.

[00:07:047.34 --> 00:07:048.18] [SPEAKER_04]  Here's how this works.

[00:07:048.36 --> 00:07:051.06] [SPEAKER_04]  Here's like that type of like environment set up for that.

[00:07:051.64 --> 00:07:052.72] [SPEAKER_04]  So definitely go check that out.

[00:07:052.72 --> 00:07:054.82] [SPEAKER_04]  I'm probably gonna go to a few of those if I can as well,

[00:07:054.82 --> 00:07:056.26] [SPEAKER_04]  just to sort of see how it flows.

[00:07:056.68 --> 00:07:059.96] [SPEAKER_04]  But it's something that we don't have a lot of clear comms

[00:07:059.96 --> 00:08:001.04] [SPEAKER_04]  about across the org.

[00:08:001.68 --> 00:08:003.26] [SPEAKER_04]  So just flagging that for people.

[00:08:003.26 --> 00:08:004.46] [SPEAKER_04]  If you can't find it,

[00:08:005.50 --> 00:08:008.62] [SPEAKER_04]  I will, let's chat in package.

[00:08:009.20 --> 00:08:015.30] [SPEAKER_01]  There's a, there's also a link in the, um, the description of the backend channel.

[00:08:015.34 --> 00:08:019.24] [SPEAKER_01]  There's a link for the backend call, which includes the agenda document.

[00:08:020.06 --> 00:08:021.28] [SPEAKER_04]  Okay, have you been going to that?

[00:08:021.79 --> 00:08:022.09] [SPEAKER_00]  Mm-hmm.

[00:08:023.37 --> 00:08:027.23] [SPEAKER_04]  Nice. And how is that something that you find helpful so far?

[00:08:029.36 --> 00:08:033.62] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah, I mean, it's very back and forth. Like some weeks, it doesn't even really happen because

[00:08:033.62 --> 00:08:038.70] [SPEAKER_01]  nobody puts anything on the agenda. And then other weeks, a few people will show up and read

[00:08:038.70 --> 00:08:044.96] [SPEAKER_01]  from some other people's notes. But it's I like it just to, you know, get a little

[00:08:044.96 --> 00:08:046.82] [SPEAKER_01]  face time with some people in other areas.

[00:08:047.70 --> 00:08:053.06] [SPEAKER_04]  Nice. Yeah, so I would say that it sounds like as an org, we're going to try and invest a little

[00:08:053.06 --> 00:08:057.80] [SPEAKER_04]  bit more in that meeting. So maybe have a think about what you think could be really useful there.

[00:08:058.12 --> 00:09:001.72] [SPEAKER_04]  There's a suggestion of, like I said, tips and tricks and whatnot, and even making it somewhat

[00:09:001.72 --> 00:09:008.10] [SPEAKER_04]  of a social thing. If there wasn't any tips and tricks, I think there's problems with scaling.

[00:09:008.22 --> 00:09:012.68] [SPEAKER_04]  Once you get the tipping points, once you go through scaling of social things where it gets

[00:09:012.68 --> 00:09:017.12] [SPEAKER_04]  to like 10 people in it, there's just too many people for anyone to really feel like they're

[00:09:017.52 --> 00:09:023.42] [SPEAKER_04]  social value out of something, I think. But that's something definitely worth looking at. Thank you

[00:09:023.42 --> 00:09:029.36] [SPEAKER_04]  for that. And maybe think about any other items you want to suggest for that, like in that realm

[00:09:029.36 --> 00:09:034.42] [SPEAKER_04]  of like, hey, how should this work? Maybe there's ideas of like, here's a cool MR or here's an issue

[00:09:034.42 --> 00:09:046.48] [SPEAKER_04]  here as I resolve this, whatever ideas you think are useful, and maybe put them forward in the

[00:09:047.28 --> 00:09:051.48] [SPEAKER_04]  questions for anyone. That's the end of our items in our agenda. Does anyone have anything

[00:09:051.48 --> 00:10:001.66] [SPEAKER_04]  else they want to raise? Awkward amount of silence. Yes.

[00:10:003.42 --> 00:10:010.54] [SPEAKER_02]  I'll add something. We have a front end weekly call as well. And Dan, it is hard to kind of scale

[00:10:010.54 --> 00:10:015.96] [SPEAKER_02]  on that social level. So one thing we've been doing recently is every month we'll do a front

[00:10:015.96 --> 00:10:020.12] [SPEAKER_02]  end themed call where it gives everybody an opportunity to like, like someone will pick like

[00:10:020.12 --> 00:10:023.70] [SPEAKER_02]  what's your favorite movie, what's your favorite book, and everybody will list that stuff out.

[00:10:023.82 --> 00:10:033.22] [SPEAKER_02]  And then everybody votes and chooses a winner and then the winner picks the next theme for

[00:10:033.22 --> 00:10:037.66] [SPEAKER_02]  some social interaction on a larger scale. So just wanted to throw that out there as an idea.

[00:10:038.79 --> 00:10:041.43] [SPEAKER_04]  Yeah, Tim mentioned that to me as well.

[00:10:043.41 --> 00:10:048.87] [SPEAKER_04]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not trying to set what people do in there and what people find

[00:10:048.87 --> 00:10:051.63] [SPEAKER_04]  interesting out of those calls, but I think that's a good suggestion.

[00:10:053.05 --> 00:10:058.81] [SPEAKER_04]  Tim said that there's probably going to be an effort maybe in a couple of weeks to get a few

[00:10:058.81 --> 00:11:002.65] [SPEAKER_04]  engineering managers together to sort of help start seeding what's in the back end call,

[00:11:002.65 --> 00:11:009.63] [SPEAKER_04]  because it sounds like the back end call isn't as mature a process or interaction as the front end

[00:11:009.63 --> 00:11:015.73] [SPEAKER_04]  call is. So there might be some effort getting put towards that here in a couple of weeks or soon.

[00:11:017.73 --> 00:11:025.63] [SPEAKER_04]  Yeah, I think the other update, I guess, is that we may be increasing our hiring generally across

[00:11:025.63 --> 00:11:033.53] [SPEAKER_04]  QtLab in Q4. There's a little flag, which it may not impact the package team beyond what we already

[00:11:033.53 --> 00:11:041.83] [SPEAKER_04]  are, but there might be extra peeps at a higher rate of peeps coming on board. So if it wasn't

[00:11:041.83 --> 00:11:048.59] [SPEAKER_04]  already a lot of peeps already. So cool. Anything else anyone wants to discuss?

[00:11:048.98 --> 00:11:049.30] [SPEAKER_01]  today.

[00:11:054.12 --> 00:12:000.22] [SPEAKER_04]  and awkward silence. Yes. All right. I think that's good to wrap up. And I think I just wanted to say

[00:12:000.22 --> 00:12:005.12] [SPEAKER_04]  thank you so much for everyone joining us and Axel, lovely to see you. And thank you so much

[00:12:005.12 --> 00:12:011.78] [SPEAKER_04]  for your hard work. And I hope everyone has a good rest of however much as rest of their day,

[00:12:011.80 --> 00:12:013.62] [SPEAKER_04]  lives left of their day. Thanks.

[00:12:016.42 --> 00:12:017.04] [SPEAKER_03]  Thanks, everyone.

[00:12:017.42 --> 00:12:018.38] [SPEAKER_03]  OK, bye-bye.

[00:12:018.86 --> 00:12:019.34] [SPEAKER_03]  Thank you.

[00:12:019.44 --> 00:12:019.66] [SPEAKER_03]  Bye.

[00:12:019.90 --> 00:12:020.00] [SPEAKER_03]  Bye.

[00:12:016.45 --> 00:12:016.45] [SPEAKER_01] 

[00:12:016.52 --> 00:12:016.94] [SPEAKER_02]  Thanks, everyone.
